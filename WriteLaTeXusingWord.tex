% WriteLaTeXinWord.tex
% Notice: 
	% Now using \input command to add draft.tex
		% \input{filename} does not force page breaks. 
		% Typically used to add smaller chunks of content, 
		% For example, \input is a good choice to add a formula or table from a separate source file
	% \include adds a page break before the added content. 
		% This is great for chapters, which are physically separated from previous and subsequent contents.
